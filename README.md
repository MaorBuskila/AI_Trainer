# AI Personal Trainer

This project aims to develop a personal training system that can analyze the correctness of exercises, count good repetitions, and provide real-time feedback to the user. The system utilizes a camera to capture the user's movements and analyze the joints to ensure proper exercise form. The system also includes a real-time bar that indicates a good complete repetition of the exercise. Moreover, the system highlights the contours of the body part that performs the exercise.
